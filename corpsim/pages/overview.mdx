The Overview page is your fast operational snapshot.

## What You See

- Current week
- Open orders
- Trades (last 100)
- Companies
- Total cash
- Reserved cash
- System integrity status

## How It Works

- Values come from the same world health snapshot used across the dashboard.
- Trades are counted from the latest 100 trade records.
- "Reserved cash" is cash committed to open buy-order reserves.
- Integrity checks look for invalid states like:
  - reserved cash greater than cash
  - reserved inventory greater than inventory
  - negative balances or quantities

If integrity issues exist, the page shows a short list and links you to **World Status** for full context.

## Player Tips

- A rising reserved-cash value with flat total cash usually means your buy exposure is growing.
- Use this page first, then jump to Market/Finance/World Status based on what moved.
