Inventory shows stock for your active company in a selected region.

## Main Controls

- Item search (code/name)
- Region selector
- Show reserved toggle

Default region follows your active company's home region.

## Quantity Columns

- Quantity: total units in that region.
- Reserved: units locked by active commitments.
- Available: `quantity - reserved`.

Reserved quantity is typically driven by:

- Open sell orders
- Production inputs reserved for running jobs

## Refresh Behavior

- Loads immediately on page open and filter changes.
- Re-syncs when simulation week advances.

## Player Tips

- Low available with high reserved means commitments are blocking new actions.
- Toggle "Show reserved" to diagnose why operations are blocked.
