Production turns input inventory into output items over time.

## Main Sections

- Start Production
- Recipes table
- Running Jobs
- Completed Recently

## Start Job Behavior

To start a job:

- Pick an unlocked recipe.
- Enter run quantity.
- Use an active company.

At job start:

- Required input quantities are reserved immediately.
- Job status becomes running.
- Due week is `start week + recipe duration`.

## Completion Behavior

When due week is reached:

- Reserved inputs are consumed.
- Output quantity is added to inventory.
- Job status becomes completed.

The completion itself does not add/subtract cash directly.

## Cancel Behavior

Cancel works only for running jobs.

When canceled:

- Reserved inputs are released back to available inventory.
- No output is produced.
- Job status becomes canceled.

## Player Tips

- If a job cannot start, check input availability in the same region as your company.
- Long-running recipes can lock key inputs; monitor reserved inventory in Inventory page.
