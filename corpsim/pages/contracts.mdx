Contracts are system-generated purchase offers you can accept and deliver against.

## Tabs

- Available: open offers you can accept.
- My Contracts: accepted/active contracts for your company.
- History: fulfilled, expired, or canceled outcomes.

## Offer Lifecycle

Contracts move through statuses:

- Open -> Accepted -> Partially Fulfilled -> Fulfilled
- Or Open/Accepted/Partially Fulfilled -> Expired

Generation and expiry are tied to weekly simulation processing.

## Accept Behavior

When you accept:

- Contract is assigned to your selected seller company.
- It leaves Available and appears in My Contracts.
- Acceptance fails if another actor changed the contract first.

## Fulfillment Behavior

For each fulfillment action:

- Quantity must be positive and <= remaining amount.
- Your company must have enough available item stock.
- Contract buyer must still have enough cash.

Settlement:

- Goods move from your inventory to buyer inventory.
- Cash transfers buyer -> seller.
- Remaining quantity updates; status becomes partial or fulfilled.

## Player Tips

- Expiry countdown matters: an accepted contract can still expire if unfinished.
- Partial fulfillment can reduce risk when your stock is uncertain.
