Analytics turns executed trade history into price/volume signals.

## Main Controls

- Item selector
- Region selector
- Data-point window (50/100/200)

## KPI Definitions

- Last Price: latest candle close.
- Change (Window): change from first open to last close in selected window.
- High / Low: extrema across candles in window.
- Avg Volume: average candle volume.
- VWAP (Window): volume-weighted average across the window.

## Candle Behavior

One candle is produced per week per item+region when trades exist.

Each candle includes:

- Open / High / Low / Close
- Volume
- Trade count
- VWAP

No trades means no candle for that week.

## Chart Behavior

The chart combines:

- OHLC bars for price
- Volume bars below
- Hover readout for week-level OHLC + volume

## Player Tips

- Use region selector to compare market structure, not just one headline price.
- A flat price with rising volume can signal stronger liquidity before visible trend changes.
