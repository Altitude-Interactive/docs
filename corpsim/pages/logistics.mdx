Logistics moves goods between regions and helps compare route economics.

## Main Sections

- Create Shipment
- Route Margin Analysis
- In Transit
- Delivered / Cancelled history

## Shipment Creation Rules

- Destination must be a different region.
- Quantity must be a positive integer.
- Source inventory must have enough available units.
- Company must have enough available cash for shipment fee.

Fee model:

- `fee = base fee + (per-unit fee * quantity)`
- Default values are 250 cents base and 15 cents per unit.

Travel times:

- Core to Industrial: 5 weeks
- Frontier to Industrial: 7 weeks
- Core to Frontier: 10 weeks

## What Happens On Create

- Quantity is removed from source-region inventory immediately.
- Shipment fee is charged immediately.
- Shipment enters `In transit` with an ETA week.

## Delivery and Cancel

- Delivery occurs automatically once ETA week is reached.
- On delivery, units are added to destination-region inventory.
- Canceling an in-transit shipment returns goods to source region.

Cancellation returns goods, but shipment fee is still a sunk cost.

## Route Margin Analysis

The panel compares recent market prices by region for selected item.

- Unit spread = destination last price - source last price
- Net route spread = `(unit spread * quantity) - estimated shipment fee`

This is an estimate, not a guaranteed realized profit.
