Finance is your cash and ledger audit workspace.

## Main Sections

- Finance Filters
- Summary cards (start/end/net changes)
- Activity summary counters
- Breakdown by transaction category
- Reconciliation panel
- Ledger table with pagination

## Filters and Window

You can filter ledger rows by:

- week range (`from`, `to`)
- transaction category
- reference category/id search
- row limit

Window size controls summary calculations over recent weeks.

## Ledger Behavior

- Ledger is paged with cursor-based Previous/Next.
- References are masked in table text, but IDs can be copied.
- Category labels are normalized into player-readable names.

## Reconciliation Behavior

Reconciliation compares:

- current company cash
- current reserved cash
- latest ledger `balance after`

If cash and latest ledger balance differ, page flags a mismatch.

## Cash Model Basics

- Cash: total cash balance.
- Reserved cash: cash committed to open buy orders.
- Ledger tracks both cash deltas and reserved-cash deltas.

## Player Tips

- Use category breakdown first, then drill into ledger rows with filters.
- If reserved cash is high, check open buy orders in Market before assuming spend leakage.
