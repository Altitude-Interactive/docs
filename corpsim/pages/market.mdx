The Market page manages price discovery and order execution.

## Main Sections

- My Orders
- Trades Filters
- Recent Trades

## Order Placement Rules

- Orders are always placed for your active company.
- Order region is your company's home region.
- Buy orders require sufficient **available cash**.
- Sell orders require sufficient **available inventory**.

Validation:

- Price must be positive.
- Quantity must be a positive integer.

## Reservation Behavior

- Buy order reserve: `price * quantity` is moved into reserved cash.
- Sell order reserve: quantity is moved into reserved inventory.

When an open order is canceled, remaining reserves are released.

## Matching Behavior

Matching runs per week by item and region.

- Buy priority: highest price first, then earlier time.
- Sell priority: lowest price first, then earlier time.
- A trade happens only when `best buy >= best sell`.
- Execution price uses the **resting (older) order's price**.

Settlement updates:

- Buyer cash decreases, reserved cash decreases.
- Seller cash increases.
- Inventory moves seller -> buyer in the same region.

## Refresh Behavior

- Market tables refresh after actions and when the week changes.
- Tick-based refresh is debounced (short delay) to avoid flicker.

## Player Tips

- A large gap between open buy/sell prices means fewer immediate fills.
- If "My Orders" stays open for many weeks, check your price vs current order-book priority.
