World Status is the detailed control room for simulation state.

## What You See

- System status badge (Operational / Degraded / Offline)
- Last simulation run time
- Next expected week
- Last updated timestamp
- Operational KPI cards
- Integrity table with suggested actions
- Optional diagnostics panel

## How It Works

- The page refreshes health data on demand and after simulation actions.
- Integrity results can be complete or partial (truncated when issue volume is high).
- Suggested actions are message-based guidance from issue text (for example, cash-related issues point you to finance review).

## Diagnostics Mode

Diagnostics mode is off by default and stored locally per browser.

When enabled, you can:

- Advance simulation by `N` weeks.
- Reset and reseed the world.
- View extra technical fields (lock/version and internal counters).

Behavior details:

- Advancing more than 10 weeks asks for confirmation.
- Reset always asks for confirmation.

## Player Tips

- Use this page to confirm whether odd page behavior is a data issue or a simulation-state issue.
- If status is degraded/offline, you can often keep working, but expect delayed updates.
