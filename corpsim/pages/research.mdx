Research unlocks capabilities (mainly recipe access) through timed initiatives.

## Main Sections

- Research Program summary
- Tiered node list
- Node details panel

## Node States

- Locked: prerequisites not complete.
- Available: prerequisites complete, can start.
- Researching: currently running.
- Completed: finished and unlocked.

## Start Behavior

Starting research:

- Requires an active player-owned company.
- Requires prerequisites to be completed.
- Deducts the full cash cost immediately.
- Starts countdown based on node duration.

There is no partial-payment model.

## Cancel Behavior

Canceling a running node:

- Stops the running job.
- Returns node to Available or Locked (based on prerequisites).
- **Does not refund research cost**.

## Completion Behavior

When completion week is reached:

- Node status becomes Completed.
- Any linked recipes are unlocked for that company.

## Player Tips

- Use tier view to plan dependency order before spending cash.
- If cash is tight, treat research as irreversible spend once started.
