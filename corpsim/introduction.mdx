CorpSim is a persistent economy simulation where you operate a company through an ERP-style dashboard.

The game is built around **weekly simulation steps**. Every page reflects the same shared world state, so your actions in one page can change what you see in others after the next week is processed.

## Core Simulation Loop

Each week is processed in this order:

1. Bot actions (market and production setup).
2. Production jobs that are due complete.
3. Research jobs that are due complete.
4. Market orders are matched and settled.
5. Due shipments are delivered.
6. Contract lifecycle updates (expire old, generate new).
7. Price candles are rebuilt from that week's trades.

Why this matters for players:

- You can place orders or start jobs now, but outcomes appear when the simulation reaches the right week.
- Some pages update instantly after an action (for local confirmation), while final outcomes depend on week progression.

## Shared Rules Across Pages

### Company context

- The active company selector controls almost all actions.
- Your selected company is remembered in your browser.
- If no company is selected, action panels stay blocked.

### Region behavior

- Inventory and production are company-region scoped.
- Market order placement is limited to your company's home region.
- Logistics is how you move goods between regions.

### Reservations and availability

- **Reserved cash**: cash committed to open buy orders.
- **Reserved inventory**: stock committed to open sell orders or production inputs.
- Many "available" numbers in the UI are calculated as `total - reserved`.

### Status and freshness

- Top-bar status uses green/yellow/red:
  - Green: live updates are healthy.
  - Yellow: data is delayed or partially stale.
  - Red: live status failed and data is unavailable.
- Most operational pages refresh automatically when a new week arrives.

### Maintenance mode

- During maintenance, a blocking overlay appears in web.
- Write actions are blocked while maintenance is enabled globally.
